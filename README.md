# Discord_Social_Embed
A python script that can be use for social media embed for Twitter (or X), BlueSky, Reddit, Pixiv on discord.<br/>
Inspired by https://github.com/seriaati/embed-fixer

To, make it work on Windows :
```
- Download the .pyw file
- Put it somewhere on your disk
- Create a shortcut of the program
- Do WIN+R, then "shell:startup" and place only trhe shortcut it here
```
So it start in silent mode with no windows in the background at the next restart
